This project defines a simple web page of students records, that can run locally and through cloud.
For this we have used AWS Elastic Bean Stalk to run the website in the cloud.

Steps as follows:
Using HTML and CSS design and develop a website and make sure that are functioanble 
Add all the student's data that includes their name, USN, email and marks.
Create a flask configuration such that it can be used as a key to start the website locally.
Create a Docker file image such that all the files are in the form of an docker image stored in the container.
Create an AWS account by following the steps given.
Search for elastic bean stalk or EBS.
Follow the steps in order to develop a EBS section.
Note you need to create a EC2 service role and a key pair.
Both EC2 service role and the instance role needs certain permissions to be given, for that search for IAM and create a EC2 role.
You need to find the necessary roles required in order to deploy your project in the EBS.
Once everything is done start deploying and only the strength signal is "GREEN" your project is ready to go live. 
Note on the right top corner there's an option "Upload and Deploy", it's not necessary to click on that as EBS itself provides it's own domain link to access your wesbite live.
Thank you.
